# 🎓 Python Dictionary and List Slicing Tasks

This repository contains two simple Python programs demonstrating the use of **dictionaries** and **list slicing**.  
These exercises are designed for beginners learning basic data structures and manipulation in Python.

## 🧮 Task 1: Create a Dictionary of Student Marks (`task1.py`)

This program creates a dictionary where student names are the keys and their marks are the values.  
It asks the user to input a student's name and displays the corresponding marks if found.

### 💻 Example Run
```
Enter the student's name: Alice

Alice's marks: 85
```
If the student's name does not exist:
```
Enter the student's name: John

Student not found.
```

### 🧠 Concepts Used
- Dictionary creation and access  
- User input using `input()`  
- Conditional statements (`if-else`)  
- Formatted string output (`f-strings`)

## 🔢 Task 2: Demonstrate List Slicing (`task2.py`)

This program creates a list of numbers from 1 to 10, extracts the first five elements, reverses them,  
and prints both the extracted list and the reversed list.

### 💻 Example Run
```
Original list: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
Extracted first five elements: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
Reversed extracted elements: [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]
```

### 🧠 Concepts Used
- List slicing (`list[start:end]`)  
- Reversing lists using slicing (`[::-1]`)  
- Printing formatted lists
